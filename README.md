# Software Craft Notebook

The notebook is a living knowledge base for software development practice across web, mobile, backend, and operational domains. It combines structured curriculum plans, modular notes, project artefacts, and workflow playbooks in one place.

## Goals

- Capture evergreen learnings with consistent structure and metadata.
- Track skill growth through roadmaps, checklists, and retrospectives.
- Host project experiments alongside the knowledge that informed them.
- Keep workflows repeatable with documented rituals, prompts, and automation.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` – canonical knowledge base broken down by shared foundations, domain-specific material, skills planning, playbooks, resources, and templates.
- `projects/` – case studies, portfolio pieces, and sandbox experiments with their own artefacts.
- `ops/` – automation, tooling notes, and operational guides for maintaining the notebook.
- `archive/` – retired material retained for historical context.

Each directory contains a `README.md` (or `overview.md`) that explains its scope, conventions, and links to related sections. Changes are logged in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to keep the evolution transparent.

## Getting Started

1. Review `docs/README.md` to understand how information is organised.
2. Capture new knowledge using the templates in `docs/templates/`.
3. Plan or update goals in `docs/skills/`, then schedule actions through the playbooks.
4. Link practical experiments or deliverables into `projects/` and annotate what was learned.

## Maintenance Rhythm

- **Weekly:** Promote fresh study notes into the appropriate domain folders and update retrospectives.
- **Monthly:** Refresh skills roadmaps, archive stale notes, and prune outdated resources.
- **Quarterly:** Audit the directory structure, rotate completed work into `archive/`, and review automation in `ops/`.

The notebook embraces continuous improvement—small, frequent updates keep it relevant and dependable.
