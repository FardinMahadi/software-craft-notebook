# DevOps Domain Overview

Document delivery pipelines, infrastructure automation, observability, and incident response here. Treat each artefact as a playbook you can execute repeatedly.

## Suggested Layout

- `concepts/` – infrastructure primitives, reliability patterns, governance.
- `labs/` – environment builds, monitoring drills, chaos experiments.
- `patterns/` – deployment strategies, configuration management idioms.
- `case-studies/` – outage reviews, cost optimisation reports.
- `checklist.md` – readiness and operational guardrails.
- `resources.md` – tooling references, SRE guides, platform documentation.

Integrate tightly with `ops/` for scripts and automation, and cross-link foundational topics (observability, performance) from `docs/foundations/`.
