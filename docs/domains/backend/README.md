# Backend Domain Overview

Collect runtime, API design, data persistence, and integration knowledge here. Keep topics modular so they pair cleanly with project documentation.

## Suggested Layout

- `overview.md` – scope, goals, success metrics.
- `concepts/` – focused notes on architecture, protocols, data modelling, observability.
- `labs/` – hands-on exercises (CRUD APIs, messaging pipelines, performance drills).
- `patterns/` – reusable approaches (CQRS, event sourcing, hexagonal architecture).
- `case-studies/` – service post-mortems, migration retrospectives.
- `resources.md` – curated references (books, specifications, tools).
- `checklist.md` – operational readiness, definition-of-done.

Link shared practices (testing, security, reliability) to `docs/foundations/` to avoid duplication.
