# Mobile Domain Overview

This space captures native and cross-platform application knowledge: platform standards, UI patterns, performance profiling, and deployment practices.

## Suggested Layout

- `concepts/` – short notes for platform fundamentals (navigation, state, offline support).
- `labs/` – guided exercises (e.g., build-and-measure tasks).
- `patterns/` – architecture comparisons (MVC, MVVM, unidirectional data-flow).
- `case-studies/` – production incidents or project retrospectives.
- `resources.md` – curated references and platform documentation.
- `checklist.md` – readiness or release criteria.

Create subfolders per ecosystem (`ios/`, `android/`, `flutter/`, `react-native/`) as material grows. Cross-link shared principles back to `docs/foundations/`.
