## Goal

Build a feature card twice: once with Tailwind utilities only, once with custom CSS, then compare workflow and output.

## Steps

1. Design component requirements (image, title, list of features, CTA).
2. Implement Tailwind version using utility classes and variants for hover/focus states.
3. Recreate using custom CSS modules/SASS to highlight differences in structure.
4. Measure build size and time-to-implementation for each approach.
5. Document pros/cons and decide when to choose each path.

## Deliverables

- Two code sandboxes or repo branches showcasing each approach.
- Notes on class composition, readability, and maintainability.
- TODOs for future component abstractions or config tweaks.
