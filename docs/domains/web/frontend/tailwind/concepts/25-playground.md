# Tailwind Playground & Prototyping

## Why It Matters

- Tailwind Play and CDNs enable quick experimentation before updating core codebases.

## Core Ideas

- Tailwind Play: live editor with hot reload, class search, shareable URLs, custom config JSON.
- CDN prototyping: `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` plus inline `tailwind.config` for tokens.
- Move prototypes into the project once patterns stabilize.

## Real-World Scenario

- A designer mocked up a pricing table in Tailwind Play, shared the URL for feedback, and developers ported the classes into React components later.

## Follow-up

- [ ] Prototype a component in Tailwind Play, gather feedback, then port utilities into your codebase.
- [ ] Compare CDN prototyping vs local CLI builds to understand token parity.
- [ ] Document prototyping guidelines so experimental configs stay in sync with the project.
