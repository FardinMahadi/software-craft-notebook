## Scope

- Configure Tailwind with modern build tooling and content scanning.
- Translate design tokens into Tailwind theme extensions.
- Compose interfaces with utility classes while maintaining readability.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up Tailwind with PostCSS, autoprefixer, and framework integrations.
- Use variants (`hover:`, `focus:`, `aria-[]`) and responsive prefixes effectively.
- Decide when to refactor utility stacks into components or `@apply` extracts.

## Success Criteria

- Complete Tailwind checklist by configuring project, building components, and documenting patterns.
- Finish a lab comparing Tailwind and custom CSS implementations.
- Capture open questions about scaling Tailwind into larger projects.
