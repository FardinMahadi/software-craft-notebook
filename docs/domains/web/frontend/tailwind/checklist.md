## Setup & Configuration

- [x] Initialize Tailwind with correct content globs and build scripts.
- [x] Extend theme with core design tokens (colors, spacing, typography).
- [x] Document custom plugins or safelist patterns needed for dynamic classes.

## Component Work

- [x] Build at least two components using utilities, responsive variants, and interaction states.
- [ ] Complete `labs/utility-vs-custom.md`, contrasting Tailwind vs handcrafted CSS implementations.

## Scaling & Notes

- [ ] Record scaling considerations (bundle size, plugin strategy, component extraction) in `docs/notes/`.
- [ ] Capture any Tailwind-specific questions for follow-up in future sprints.
