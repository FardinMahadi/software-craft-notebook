## Goal

Create a landing page skeleton using only semantic HTML. Emphasize navigation, hero section, feature list, testimonial, and footer.

## Steps

1. Plan content hierarchy and map sections to HTML elements.
2. Implement navigation, hero, and main content with accessible headings.
3. Add a feature list using ordered/unordered lists depending on context.
4. Present testimonials using `<blockquote>` and `<cite>`.
5. Validate document with an accessibility checker (e.g., WAVE) and log findings.

## Deliverables

- HTML file with comments explaining landmark choices.
- Screenshot or text summary of accessibility audit results.
- Follow-up questions or TODOs linked back to this lab.
