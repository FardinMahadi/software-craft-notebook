# HTML `id` Attribute

## Why It Matters

- `id` creates a unique anchor for deep linking, scripting, and label associations.
- Duplicate IDs cause unpredictable styling and JavaScript behavior.
- Accessible forms rely on IDs to pair inputs with labels and helper text.

## Core Ideas

- Each `id` must be unique within the document; use descriptive names like `primary-nav` or `contact-form`.
- Fragment links reference IDs (`<a href="#contact-form">Contact</a>`), enabling skip links or table-of-contents jumps.
- JavaScript retrieves elements with `document.getElementById('modal')`; use IDs for one-off hooks, not general styling.
- CSS selectors with `#id` are very specific; reserve them for special cases to avoid maintainability issues.
- Associate labels and helper text using `for="email"` with `id="email"` and `aria-describedby="email-help"`.

## Real-World Scenario

- A long landing page adds “Skip to pricing” and “Skip to signup” links. Each section receives an `id`, helping keyboard users jump quickly while analytics scripts track scroll depth accurately by querying those unique anchors.

## Examples

```html
<a class="skip-link" href="#pricing">Skip to pricing</a>

<section id="pricing">
  <h2>Pricing Plans</h2>
  <!-- plan cards -->
</section>

<form id="contact-form">
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input id="email" type="email" aria-describedby="email-help" />
  <p id="email-help">We’ll only use this to send onboarding updates.</p>
</form>
```

## Follow-up

- [ ] Audit a page to make sure no IDs are duplicated.
- [ ] Create a table of contents that links to section IDs and test keyboard navigation.
- [ ] Ensure every form control has a label connected via `for`/`id`, plus helper text linked with `aria-describedby`.
