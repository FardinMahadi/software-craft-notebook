# HTML Introduction

## Why It Matters

- HTML is the backbone of every web page; it tells the browser what content exists and how it is structured.
- Understanding the basic building blocks makes it easier to learn CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks later.
- A clean HTML foundation improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

## Core Ideas

- HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language** and is composed of nested elements.
- The browser reads HTML, creates a **Document Object Model (DOM)**, and renders it visually.
- HTML5 is the modern standard; use the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to opt into it.

## Real-World Scenario

- A small coffee shop needs a basic site to share opening hours and menu items. With a simple HTML file, the owner can publish contact info in an afternoon. Later, a developer can layer on styles and ordering features without rewriting the original structure.

## Examples

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Follow-up

- [ ] Recreate the sample page in your editor and open it in a browser.
- [ ] Change the heading text and add new elements to see live updates.
- [ ] Inspect the DOM in developer tools to observe the structure.
