# HTML Editors

## Why It Matters

- The right editor helps you spot mistakes quickly and speed up repetitive HTML work.
- Beginners gain confidence when they can save, reload, and see results without friction.
- Productivity tooling (linting, snippets, previews) keeps files consistent in team settings.

## Core Ideas

- Any plain-text editor can write HTML as long as it saves `.html` files in UTF-8 encoding.
- Feature-rich editors (VS Code, Nova, Sublime Text) add syntax highlighting, Emmet shortcuts, and live preview extensions.
- Online sandboxes (CodePen, JSFiddle) are perfect for quick experiments without local setup.

## Real-World Scenario

- A new intern joins a marketing team and must update website copy during a product launch. With VS Code plus Live Server, they can edit `index.html`, auto-refresh the browser, and push changes within minutes—no heavyweight CMS training needed.

## Examples

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Follow-up

- [ ] Install a code editor and enable syntax highlighting + auto-formatting.
- [ ] Configure a live reload extension (e.g., VS Code Live Server) and test a simple page.
- [ ] Try an online sandbox to share a quick experiment with a friend or teammate.
