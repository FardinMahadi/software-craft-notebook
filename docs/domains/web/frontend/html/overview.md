## Scope

- Reinforce semantic document structure and accessible markup patterns.
- Practice authoring common content types: navigation, lists, tables, and forms.
- Prepare clean HTML scaffolds for CSS and Tailwind layering.

## Learning Objectives

- Compose pages with logical landmarks and metadata that support assistive tech.
- Model complex data with tables while preserving readability on small screens.
- Build form flows with validation-ready markup and descriptive labels.

## Success Criteria

- Complete the HTML checklist for semantic layout, lists, and tables.
- Ship at least one lab documenting accessible table/list implementations.
- Capture open questions in topic notes and reference them from `docs/notes/`.

## Links

- Concepts: numbered files under `concepts/` follow the full HTML learning path (e.g., `01-introduction.md`, `13-links.md`, `27-responsive.md`, `50-accessibility-checks.md`).
- Labs: `labs/semantic-layout.md`
- Resources: `resources.md`
- Checklist: `checklist.md`
