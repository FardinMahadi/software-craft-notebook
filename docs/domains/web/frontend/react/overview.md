## Scope

- Learn modern React concepts from component basics through state management and effects.
- Practice building interactive UIs while keeping components predictable and testable.
- Capture insights from the official React learning track in numbered concept notes.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe UI with components, JSX, and props.
- Manage state, events, and data flow between components.
- Apply hooks, context, and reducers to scale interactivity.
- Recognize when to reach for escape hatches like refs and effects.

## Success Criteria

- Concept notes `concepts/01-quick-start.md` onward summarize each React learn section.
- Labs document hands-on exercises for components, state, and data flow.
- Checklist items completed with links to supporting examples or notes.
