## Goal

Build a mini dashboard that demonstrates component composition, event handling, and shared state updates.

## Tasks

1. Create `Dashboard` with sections for:
   - Recent messages list rendered from an array.
   - Counter widget that increments independently.
   - Shared counter that multiple buttons update together.
2. Implement controlled form input that updates a preview card in real time.
3. Add a theme toggle using lifted state and pass it to child components.

## Deliverables

- Screenshots or GIF showing interactivity.
- Snippets illustrating state updates, list rendering with keys, and lifted state.
- A short retrospective: what felt natural, what React patterns need more practice.
