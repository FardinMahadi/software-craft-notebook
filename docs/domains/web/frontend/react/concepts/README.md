# React Concepts Learning Path

Cover the notes in numerical order to build foundations before touching advanced tooling:

1. `01-installation-setup.md` — Environment, tooling, and project scaffolding.
2. `02-quick-start.md` — Components, JSX, props, lists, and shared state basics.
3. `03-describing-ui.md` — Component organization, props, conditional rendering, and purity.
4. `04-thinking-in-react.md` — Systematic approach to breaking UIs into components and data flow decisions.
5. `05-adding-interactivity.md` — Events, state lifecycle, batching, and immutable updates.
6. `06-managing-state.md` — Structuring state, lifting state, preserving/resetting, and pointers to reducers/context.
7. `07-reducers.md` — Reducer patterns, action design, testing, and state machines.
8. `08-context-scaling.md` — Context providers, memoization, and scaling shared state.
9. `09-hooks-and-reuse.md` — Core hooks overview, performance hooks, external stores, and custom patterns.
10. `10-escape-hatches.md` — Refs, effects, and imperative escapes.
11. `11-debugging-and-tools.md` — DevTools, error boundaries, and troubleshooting.
12. `12-react-compiler.md` — Optional advanced optimizations and compiler adoption notes.
13. `13-use-ref.md` — Detailed usage patterns for `useRef`.
14. `14-use-memo.md` — In-depth guidance on memoizing derived values.
15. `15-use-callback.md` — Stabilizing callbacks and working with memoized children.

Each concept note ends with practice prompts; complete related labs and update the module checklist as you progress.
