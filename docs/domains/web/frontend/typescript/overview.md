## Scope

- Bridge JavaScript knowledge to strongly typed React applications.
- Cover language essentials, React typing patterns, and tooling configuration.

- Author typed React components, hooks, and context providers.
- Integrate TypeScript with build tools (Vite, Next.js, ESLint).
- Use type guards and advanced patterns to improve reliability.

## Success Criteria

- Concept notes `concepts/01-ts-basics.md` onward are completed with examples.
- Checklist items reference code samples or labs demonstrating typed React components.
- Labs reinforce typing forms, hooks, and API interactions.
