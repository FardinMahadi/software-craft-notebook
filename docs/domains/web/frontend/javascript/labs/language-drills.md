## Goal

Build hands-on proficiency with modern JavaScript features used in React by implementing small utilities and refactoring exercises.

## Tasks

1. Refactor a legacy script using `var`/IIFE patterns into modules with `let`/`const` and arrow functions.
2. Implement a stateful closure (`createCounter`, `createStore`) and document how it differs from React state.
3. Transform a dataset of objects using immutable updates (add/remove/update) and compare before/after references.
4. Wrap `fetch` in a helper that supports retries, timeouts, and abort handling; write usage examples.

## Deliverables

- Code snippets or linked files demonstrating each exercise.
- Notes on pitfalls encountered (scope bugs, mutation issues, async ordering).
- Follow-up questions or TODOs captured in `docs/notes/`.
