## Scope

- Cement modern JavaScript concepts required to work confidently with React and MERN projects.
- Focus on language features, data handling, modules, and async patterns seen in React apps.
- Capture concise notes and practice prompts mapped to the React learning path.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand ES6+ syntax, execution model, and module system.
- Manage functions, closures, and state immutably.
- Work with objects, arrays, and data transformations idiomatically.
- Handle asynchronous flows using promises, async/await, and browser APIs.

## Success Criteria

- Concept notes `concepts/01-language-basics.md` onward are completed with practice prompts.
- Checklist items linked to notes/labs are marked done with evidence in commits.
- Labs demonstrate language features supporting React development.

## Links

- Concepts: numbered notes under `concepts/` (e.g., `01-language-basics.md`, `04-async-patterns.md`).
- Labs: `labs/` (populate with exercises as concepts are applied).
- Resources: `resources.md`
