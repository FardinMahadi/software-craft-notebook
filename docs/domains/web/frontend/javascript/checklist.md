## Language Essentials

- [ ] Review execution model, declarations, and block scoping with `let`/`const`.
- [ ] Practice destructuring, spread, and rest operators in real examples.

## Functions & Data

- [ ] Implement closures and higher-order functions to manage state.
- [ ] Work with immutable updates on arrays and objects (map/filter/reduce, spread).

## Modules & Tooling

- [ ] Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) and understand bundler behavior.
- [ ] Configure linting/formatting rules enforcing modern JavaScript style.

## Async & Browser APIs

- [ ] Build promise-based workflows and migrate them to async/await.
- [ ] Handle errors and cancellation (AbortController, try/catch) in async code.

## Labs & Notes

- [ ] Complete language labs under `labs/` and link results in concept notes.
- [ ] Capture supplemental study notes in `docs/notes/` with key takeaways.
