## Goal

Refactor an existing two-column layout from floats to modern flexbox/grid while maintaining visual parity.

## Steps

1. Snapshot current layout and note pain points (clearfixes, margin hacks).
2. Rebuild structure using grid for outer frame, flexbox for internal alignment.
3. Extract spacing and sizing tokens into custom properties.
4. Evaluate responsiveness at 320px, 768px, 1024px viewports; adjust as needed.
5. Document improvements, remaining issues, and performance observations.

## Deliverables

- Before/after screenshots or code snippets.
- Notes on cascade cleanup and specificity reductions.
- TODOs for future enhancements or cross-browser checks.
