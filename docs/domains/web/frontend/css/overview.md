## Scope

- Master the cascade, specificity, and architecture patterns for maintainable styles.
- Apply layout systems (box model, flexbox, grid) to responsive interfaces.
- Manage design tokens through custom properties and modern sizing techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Diagnose specificity conflicts and structure stylesheets to minimize overrides.
- Build responsive layouts using flexbox for one dimension and grid for two.
- Use fluid typography and spacing with `clamp()`, viewport units, and container queries.

## Success Criteria

- Complete CSS checklist covering box model, layout systems, and responsive strategies.
- Document experiments in labs and capture follow-up notes.
- Reference CSS learnings in cross-topic notes when integrating with Tailwind.
