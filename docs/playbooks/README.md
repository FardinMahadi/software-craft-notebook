# Playbooks

Codify recurring rituals so planning, execution, and reflection stay intentional.

## Subdirectories

- `prompts/` – AI assistant prompts and question banks for research.
- `reflections/` – weekly and monthly retrospectives.
- `schedules/` – time-blocking templates and sprint plans.
- `rituals/` (optional) – daily routines, stand-ups, review checklists.

Each playbook should include:

- **Purpose** – why the ritual exists.
- **Cadence** – when it runs.
- **Inputs & outputs** – supporting docs and expected artefacts.
- **Checklist** – bullet list to ensure consistency.

Update playbooks monthly as habits evolve, and link any supporting automation in `ops/`.
