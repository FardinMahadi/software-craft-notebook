# Reflections Directory Guide

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Use reflections to tie outcomes back to the roadmap and adjust course quickly.

Suggested layout:

```
reflections/
  weekly/
    yyyy-mm-dd.md   # wins, blockers, next focus
  monthly/
    summary-yyyy-mm.md  # highlight metrics, lessons, roadmap updates
  retrospectives/
    project-name.md     # deeper dives for major builds
```

Each entry should include:

- **Snapshot:** what you attempted this period.
- **Evidence:** links to modules, notes, or repos.
- **Adjustments:** what to change next (schedule, resources, focus).
- **Mood/energy check:** quick 1-5 rating to monitor burnout or momentum.

Keep weekly notes <250 words; expand only in retrospectives.
