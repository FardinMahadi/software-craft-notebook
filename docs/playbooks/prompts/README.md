# Prompts Directory Guide

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Centralize AI prompts and study scripts so you can reuse and iterate on them intentionally.

- `agent-config.md` — baseline instructions for the assistant(s) you use most.
- `<goal>-prompt.md` — targeted prompts (e.g., `debugging-prompt.md`, `flashcard-generator.md`).
- Keep each prompt file focused; note the expected input format and ideal outputs.
- Record experiment results or adjustments at the bottom under `Refinements`.
- When a prompt becomes obsolete, move it to `docs/learning/archive/prompts/` with a brief note on why.
