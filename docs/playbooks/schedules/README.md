# Schedules Directory Guide

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Plan your study cadence and keep templates handy for quick reuse.

- `weekly-template.md` — recurring layout with focus blocks and habits.
- `focus-sprint/` — folder of time-bound plans (`sprint-01.md`, etc.) describing goals, blockers, and checkpoints.
- `calendar-sync.md` — instructions for syncing with personal calendars or reminder apps.
- `buffers.md` — list of pre-approved catch-up sessions to keep momentum when life happens.

Keep each schedule file scoped to one timebox (week, sprint, etc.). When a plan is executed, annotate outcomes and link the post-mortem note in `reflections/`.
