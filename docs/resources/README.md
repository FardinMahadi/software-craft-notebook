# Resources Directory Guide

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Curate concise, high-value references to support each module.

- Organize by topic: `web.md`, `backend.md`, `career.md`, etc.
- Use tables or short bullet lists (≤15 items per file) with a one-line annotation per resource.
- Mark priority with emojis or `P1/P2` tags if helpful.
- Maintain a `reading-list.md` to track books/courses with status (queued / in-progress / done).
- For large collections, split into subfolders (e.g., `resources/testing/automation.md`) rather than extending a single page.

Archive outdated links to `archive/resources/` to avoid clutter and capture why they were retired.
