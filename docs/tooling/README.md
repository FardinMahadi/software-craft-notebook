# Tooling & Automation

Document environment setup, scripts, troubleshooting steps, and CI/CD helpers here.

## Suggested Structure

- `setup/` – platform-specific installation guides.
- `scripts/` – reusable automation (PowerShell, Bash, Node, etc.).
- `troubleshooting/` – incident logs and fixes.
- `ci/` – pipeline configurations, link checks, linting routines.

Reference operational playbooks in `docs/playbooks/` and keep executable files under version control when feasible.
