# Notes Inbox

Use this space for quick captures before they become evergreen knowledge.

## Format

- File names follow `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.
- Keep entries under ~250 words; summarise and link to supporting material.
- Include a `## Promote` section listing where the insight should eventually land.

## Weekly Process

1. Capture freely during study or project work.
2. During the weekly review, migrate durable insights into `docs/foundations/` or the relevant domain folder.
3. Close the loop by adding backlink references and updating checklists or roadmaps.

Archive processed notes quarterly under `archive/notes/`.
