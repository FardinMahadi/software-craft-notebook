# Foundations

Record universal principles that underpin every domain: system design, testing strategies, architectural styles, security, accessibility, performance, and collaboration practices.

## Organisation

- Create subfolders per theme (`architecture/`, `testing/`, `quality/`, `security/`, `ux/`, `collaboration/`).
- Each theme mirrors the standard bundle:
  - `overview.md`
  - `concepts/`
  - `labs/` or `drills/`
  - `patterns/`
  - `resources.md`
  - `checklist.md`

## Usage Guidelines

1. Reference foundational material from domain notes instead of re-writing it.
2. Capture trade-offs and decision records so the context behind patterns remains clear.
3. Tag files consistently (e.g., `tags: [architecture, scalability]`) for future search/automation.
4. When a foundational concept drives a project deliverable, link both ways between `docs/foundations/` and `projects/`.
