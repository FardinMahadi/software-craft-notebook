# Skills & Growth

Use this directory to translate long-term aspirations into actionable plans.

## Core Files

- `milestones.md` – rolling list of objectives (≤2 pages); split by quarter when needed.
- `skills-matrix.md` – competence tracking (beginner / practicing / confident).
- `roadmap/` – quarterly roadmaps (`q1-2026.md`, etc.) with planned modules and projects.
- `heatmap.csv` (optional) – habit tracker; keep binary (1/0) columns only.

## Workflow

1. Align goals with domain or foundation documents and link both ways.
2. When a milestone completes, note the date, link supporting artefacts, and log the change in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Archive superseded plans under `archive/skills/` to maintain history.
