# Archive Directory Guide

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

Keep historical documents accessible without cluttering active folders.

Mirror the active layout so content remains discoverable later:

- `skills/`
- `domains/` (with subfolders for each discipline)
- `foundations/`
- `notes/`
- `playbooks/`
- `resources/`
- `templates/`

When moving an item here:

1. Prefix the filename with its completion date (`2025-03-14-roadmap.md`).
2. Add a short header noting why it was archived and where the active successor lives.
3. Update any links in the live docs so they point to the current version.

Avoid editing archived files except to clarify context; capture new learnings in the active workspace.
