# Operations

Centralise automation, scripts, and maintenance tasks for the notebook.

## Suggested Layout

- `ci/` – pipeline definitions, link check scripts, lint configs.
- `scripts/` – reusable utilities (PowerShell, Bash, Node, Python).
- `templates/` – operational checklists (backups, audits).
- `reports/` – metrics snapshots, automation logs.

Document prerequisites for each script, note required environment variables, and cross-link to relevant playbooks or tooling guides.
