# Projects

Document practical work that applies the knowledge base.

## Structure

- `experiments/` – short-lived spikes or sandboxes. Include a quick outcome summary.
- `case-studies/` – in-depth write-ups with goals, implementation notes, and what was learned.
- `portfolio/` – polished deliverables suitable for sharing publicly.

Each project directory should contain:

- `README.md` – context, scope, and links to relevant documentation.
- `lessons-learned.md` – insights to feed back into `docs/domains/` or `docs/foundations/`.
- `artifacts/` – supporting assets (screenshots, diagrams, exports).

Reference active roadmaps in `docs/skills/` and log major milestones in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
