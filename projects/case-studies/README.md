# Case Studies

Deep dives on projects, incidents, or migrations.

## Suggested Sections

- **Context** – problem statement, constraints, stakeholders.
- **Approach** – design decisions, trade-offs, timeline.
- **Outcomes** – metrics, user impact, retrospectives.
- **Links** – source repos, relevant `docs/` material, follow-up tasks.

Summarise the most valuable insights in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and update domain notes accordingly.
